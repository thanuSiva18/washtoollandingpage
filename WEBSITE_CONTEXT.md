# Website Text Copy & Design Methodology Analysis

## Part 1: Design Methodology

### Core Philosophy
"Clean. Calm. Professional. Built by serious people."
The design rejects flashy trends (gradients, glassmorphism, excessive animation) in favor of high-trust, conversion-focused clarity. It is designed to look like a mature SaaS product that a business owner can trust with their financial data.

### Mobile-First Approach
*   **Vertical Stacking**: All layouts default to a single column on mobile, ensuring no horizontal scrolling or cramped elements.
*   **Touch Targets**: Buttons are minimum `48px` height (size="lg" or "xl") for easy thumb interaction.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Content flows logically from Problem → Solution → Proof → Action, with no side-distractions on small screens.
*   **Spaciousness**: Generous vertical whitespace to reduce cognitive load.

### Design System (Strict)
*   **Colors**:
    *   **Background**: Pure White (`#ffffff`) - No off-whites or patterns for the main canvas.
    *   **Headlines**: Slate 900 (`#0F172A`) - Near-black for maximum contrast and authority.
    *   **Body Text**: Slate 600 (`#475569`) - Muted enough to soften the page but legible.
    *   **Primary Action**: Blue 600 (`#2563EB`) - The single "Action Color". Used ONLY for buttons and key links.
    *   **Destructive/Alert**: Red 500/600 - Used sparingly for "Pain Points".
*   **Typography**:
    *   **Font Family**: System Sans / Inter (Clean, modern, legible).
    *   **Headlines**: Bold/Extrabold weights, tight letter-spacing (`tracking-tight`), tight line-height.
    *   **Body**: Regular weight, relaxed line-height for readability.
*   **UI Patterns**:
    *   **Cards**: White background, thin border (`border-slate-200`), subtle shadow (`shadow-sm` or `shadow-soft`).
    *   **Shadows**: Used only to create depth (e.g., lifting the phone mockup), not for decoration.
    *   **Phone Mockup**: "Anchored" design (dark border, realistic shadow) rather than floating/abstract.
